# AVR-AES
AES cipher implementation for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers

AVR-AES library can be used to encrypt and decrypt data with AES algorithm (Rijndael-128).
Key size is limited to 128 bits. Short description of library API is in header file. It is
configurable with definitions contained also in header file.
